# Hey there, I'm David! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a junior full-stack developer who's all about coding and creating awesome web applications. Before diving into the coding world, I used to be the Parts Manager at the top-ranking Porsche Centre in Canada. But now, I've traded sports cars for lines of code!

## Projects and Contributions

### Agilitek Solutions - Segment Comparison App

Recently, I teamed up with a few students to build a mind-blowing segment comparison app for Agilitek Solutions. This app is full-stack and fully responsive, allowing users to submit segments for analysis and extract super valuable transaction and demographic data. My main contribution to the app was developing a flexible and resizable dashboard. Now, users can customize their widgets and arrange them to their own personal layout. Check out the [dashboard in action](https://davidjkim.xyz) on my portfolio.

### Reactavision

A movie picker web app built using the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. Users can browse upcoming, top-rated, popular, and now playing movies, search for movies by title, and save their favorites to a personalized list. [Click here for a demo!](https://reactavision.vercel.app/)

### Cake Factory

A full-stack e-commerce website called The Cake Factory. It includes features such as PayPal integration, custom cake options, user registration, and order history. Customers can choose between pre-made cakes or customize their own cakes with toppings, fillings, and shape.
